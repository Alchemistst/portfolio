Hi there ðŸ‘½!

With this series of blog posts I'd like to experiment with different concepts and ideas. The goal is to make short posts with very specific concepts, isolated, without the need to build a full application to see them in action.

Why "*Nightly*"? Because most likely I'll be doing this on my spare time, and that usualy only happens at night.

I hope you find this useful, maybe as an example, maybe as inspiration or maybe to motivate you to use the concepts I explain, making you realise they weren't concepts so difficult after all.

For now, this is all.
Signing out...
