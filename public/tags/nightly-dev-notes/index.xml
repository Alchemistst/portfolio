      <description>Hi there ðŸ‘½!&#xA;In this article I wanted to do a quick demonstration on how to integrate with OpenAI Whipser model to transcript an audio file, using Typescript and ffmpeg.&#xA;In my repo you have the full code of the script that I made for this article, as well as instructions on how to use it as is.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&#xA;OpenAI integration I decided to integrate with OpenAI using a HTTP client (axios in this case) directly.</description>

      <description>Hi there ðŸ‘½!&#xA;In this article I wanted to play around and experiment with using GraphQL. And so, I made the simplest CRUD application I could came up with, a TODO list.&#xA;So&amp;hellip; GraphQL&amp;hellip; right? In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides efficient, flexible, and precise data fetching compared to traditional REST APIs.</description>

      <title>[Nightly Dev Notes] Introduction</title>

      <description>Hi there ðŸ‘½!&#xA;With this series of blog posts I&amp;rsquo;d like to experiment with different concepts and ideas. The goal is to make short posts with very specific concepts, isolated, without the need to build a full application to see them in action.&#xA;Why &amp;ldquo;Nightly&amp;rdquo;? Because most likely I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing this on my spare time, and that usualy only happens at night.&#xA;I hope you find this useful, maybe as an example, maybe as inspiration or maybe to motivate you to use the concepts I explain, making you realise they weren&amp;rsquo;t concepts so difficult after all.</description>
