            <description>Hi there 游놓!
With this series of blog posts I&amp;rsquo;d like to experiment with different concepts and ideas. The goal is to make short posts with very specific concepts, isolated, without the need to build a full application to see them in action.
Why &amp;ldquo;Nightly&amp;rdquo;? Because most likely I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing this on my spare time, and that usualy only happens at night.
I hope you find this useful, maybe as an example, maybe as inspiration or maybe to motivate you to use the concepts I explain, making you realise they weren&amp;rsquo;t concepts so difficult after all.</description>

<p>For now, this is all.
